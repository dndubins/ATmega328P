You might recognize this sound-based distance sensor from the many remote-controlled robotic project kits you can buy online. The HC-SR04 is also a very popular sensor to include in an Arduino kit. The sensor works on the principle of echo location, making a click and then listening for the echo back. The timing is used to calculate distance. The working range is 2-40 cm (about 0.8-15 inches), making this sensor good for measuring short distances, such as obstacle avoidance. The surface needs to be sound reflective though.

<p>The sketch provided here does not require a library, and can report the distance in centimetres or inches. This sketch was based on a tutorial provided here: <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/arduino-distance-sensor-hc-sr04/>"Arduino Distance Sensor using the HC-SR04 - Pi My Life Up</a>
