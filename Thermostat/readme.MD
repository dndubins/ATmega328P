Thermistors are sensitive, inexpensive, easy to waterproof, and relatively easy to calibrate. Why shouldn't you think of using one? The sketch Thermostat.h provides an example of how to set up a thermistor in the bottom half of a voltage divider, then calculate and report the temperature. The file Bcoeff.xlsx can be used to calibrate the thermitor first, in a 2-point calibration procedure. All of this *could* easily be handled by the sketch, but why have the sketch do summersaults when the calculations can be performed offline? Also, Microsoft Excel is just plain awesome.
