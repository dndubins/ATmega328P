There are two projects here as examples of SoftwareSerial connections between MCUs. The first project, 2KeyPads, is an example of one-way SoftwareSerial communication between two Arduino Unos set up as keypads. It was inspired by a student's design project in PHC435: a 2-handed Dactyl Manuform keyboard controlled by two Arduino Pro Micro Leonardos. Half-libraries of the SoftwareSerial.h library are used, since only one send-receive wire is needed.<p>
  The second example (LeapFrog) is an example of using the full SoftwareSerial.h library. An LED receives an integer from the SoftwareSerial monitor, flashes its onboard LED that number of times, then sends that number + 1 through the SoftwareSerial monitor to the other MCU.
