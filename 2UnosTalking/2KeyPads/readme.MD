This project involves using a SoftwareSerial connection from pin 2 of two different Unos to send data from one MCU to the other. Each MCU is set up with a different 4x4 matrix keypad to illustrate how the data can be handled.<p>

The "MASTER" MCU is the MCU that's receiving the data from the SLAVE, and sending it along to the regular Serial Monitor, as well as its own data.<p>
For this example, rather than dedicate a RX and TX pin for the Software Serial connection, half-libraries are used since data is only being sent one way. The libraries used here are:<p>
  SoftwareSerialIn.h v1.0 by Joe Beuckman, available at: https://github.com/jbeuckm/SoftwareSerialIn<br>
SendOnlySoftwareSerial.h v1.0 by Nick Gammon, available at: https://github.com/nickgammon/SendOnlySoftwareSerial<p>

The MASTER MCU is powered through USB. The SLAVE MCU is powered parasitically from the master (Vin - Vin, GND - GND). That way there only needs to be one connection to the computer.<p>

However, the slave.ino sketch will need to be uploaded to the SLAVE MCU through USB first.
