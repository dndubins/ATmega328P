If you run out of digital pins for your project (e.g. if you are making a 3D LED cube), and you need more, there are various strategies to go about this. One strategy is to buy a microprocessor with more pins. However, most Arduino Uno kits come with *shift registers*, which allow you to add more pins to your project easily. The 74HC595 chip is a **shift-out** register, meaning that you can use it to add digital pins to your project in OUTPUT mode. The 74HC165 chip is a **shift-in** register, meaning you are adding digital pins in INPUT mode. Each 14-pin DIP chip adds 8 extra pins, but they can be daisy-chained so that you can have as many as you like.

The sketch ShiftInOut.ino sets up one 74HC165 shift-in register, and one 74HC595 shift-out register. The shift-in register reads pin states, and outputs the answer to the shift-out register. It's a very simple illustration on how to wire up and use each chip.

The sketch ShiftOut_nchips.ino sets up two 74HC595 shift-out registers in series, and sends data to both of them.
