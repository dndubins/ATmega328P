This little accelerometer finds utility in drone and robotics applications. I used one to help home a robotic arm in the correct direction, to prevent the arm from propping itself against the counter. The Adafruit MP6050 library is very easy to use. This example sketch gives a reading in .CSV format. The first three coordinates (x,y,z) are for acceleration, and the second three are for rotation.
